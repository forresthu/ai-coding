# Wave Animation Project

## Overview
The Wave Animation Project is designed to visualize the wave function described by the wave equation (1/v^2)d²y/dt² - d²y/dx²=0. This project provides an interactive animation that demonstrates how waves propagate over time and space.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wave-animation-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the wave animation, execute the following command:

```
python src/wave_animation.py
```

This will start the animation, allowing you to visualize the wave function in real-time.

## Project Structure
- `src/wave_animation.py`: Contains the main logic for animating the wave function.
- `src/wave_solver.py`: Implements numerical methods to solve the wave equation.
- `src/utils/__init__.py`: Contains utility functions or constants used across the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `setup.py`: Configuration file for packaging the project.
